 Double Fade

 This example shows how to fade an LEDs on pin 9 and 10
 using the analogWrite() function.

 This example code is in the public domain.

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);

  // set the brightness of pin 9:
  mode++;
  mode &= 16383;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
